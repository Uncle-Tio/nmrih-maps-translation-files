## How to contribute:

When making contributions, copy the English language line and paste below and change the ID code from `"en"` to one from [this list](#language-code-table-and-status) to add new translations. 

> 💡 *Use the English line as a reference*

#### Example:
```cpp
	}
	"1cd18ac0632cae7b0cda0cf34208a767"
	{						  ↙️ Copy this entire line
		"en"		"Unlock the hospital doors."
		"pt"		"Destranque as portas do hospital."
		"pt_p"		"Destranque as portas do hospital."
	Make a new line and paste ↘️				
	   	"en"	        "Unlock the hospital doors."
    Change the ID🔺					🔺 Translate to the language you have chosen.
	}
```
#### Result:
```cpp
	}
	"1cd18ac0632cae7b0cda0cf34208a767"
	{
		"en"		"Unlock the hospital doors."
		"pt"		"Destranque as portas do hospital."
		"pt_p"		"Destranque as portas do hospital."
		"es"		"Spanish things translated..."
	}
```

### Notes

- You must escape quotes with a backslash (`\`) to prevent parsing errors.

	```cpp
	// Example 
		"es"		"Destroy \"Robert\" the puppet"
	```
